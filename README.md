# SOV
SOV is variable-rate / intelligent deflationary token with a starting supply of 1 Billion and ending supply of 21 million.  Every time SOV is moved from an account, deflation occurs via a burn rate that adjusts according to total supply.  The burn rate starts very low (0.05%), but quickly increases (1.25% max) and eventually goes to 0 over 21 stages.  Also, 7.5 million of unclaimed tokens can be burned once per week through an "airburn". This can be done by anyone with an EOS account and will stop when the account's supply is all burned or claimed.  No ICO, No Pre-sale, No investors or financial backers.  SOV is a completely decentralized project open to all who wish to contribute.  Distribution is planned to be through NewDex, Genesis Account Airgrab, and the reverberation fund. The founding team is comprised of several and only gets 9%.
